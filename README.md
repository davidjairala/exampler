# Exampler

If you like working with YML files in your Ruby projects and tend to create .example.yml files to ignore the actual settings for your projects to keep them from entering your version control, this might come in handy.

It just copies all those pesky example files into the normal YML versions.

# Usage

```bash
cd ~/projects/
git clone git@github.com:davidjairala/exampler.git
cd my_project/
../exampler/exampler
```
